= Watchlist 

Like most in the field, I often skim papers and articles. Additionally, I keep up to date with ML news by following Youtube, Spotify and Twitter. 
I will (attempt to) maintain this page with content I read, watch or listen to each week.
I hope folks in the field will find this list useful.

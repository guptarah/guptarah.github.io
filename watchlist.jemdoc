= Watchlist 

Like most in the field, I often skim papers and articles. Additionally, I keep up to date with ML news by following Youtube, Spotify and Twitter. 
Hoping that folks interested in RAI and NLP will find it useful, I will (attempt to) maintain this page with content I watched or listened to in the trailing two months.
For interesting NLP/RAI papers, please consider following [https://twitter.com/rahul1987iit my twitter feed] and [https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-gupta-16139818/ linkedIn feed].

== General notes

- Back when I switched to NLP, the [https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights NLP highlights podcast] helped me a lot to on-board onto concepts in NLP.

- You will find that I follow [https://www.youtube.com/@YannicKilcher @YannicKilcher], [https://www.youtube.com/@aiexplained-official @aiexplained-official] and [https://www.youtube.com/@stanfordonline @stanfordonline] channels regularly. 

- I am also interested in world politics, history and movies. Given an opportunity, I'd be happy to discuss these topics.

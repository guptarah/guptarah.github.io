I work with a team of scientists focusing on various research topics in Responsible AI including fairness, safety and security.
Examples of my research work include building metrics applicable to RAI (see [https://github.com/amazon-science/bold here] and [https://github.com/amazon-science/tango here]), mitigations (see [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12574.pdf here]) and analysis articles (see [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03826.pdf here]).
My team also organizes workshops and tutorials on RAI topics.  
Please feel free to browse my publications for a list of my recent research focus. 

A necessary but not sufficient condition for an AGI from my perspective: An AI is AGI if we can no longer design Captchas that can fool AI.

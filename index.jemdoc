Examples of my research work include building metrics applicable to RAI (see [https://github.com/amazon-science/bold here],[https://github.com/amazon-science/tango here]), mitigation (see [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12574.pdf here]) and analysis articles (see [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03826.pdf here]).
